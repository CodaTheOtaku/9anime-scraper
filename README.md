Or with Yarn

yarn global add 9anime

Then just run the command `9anime` from your terminal to get started! It will ask you a few questions and then the episode will start playing directly within VLC. If you don't have VLC installed you can get it here: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.en-GB.html
